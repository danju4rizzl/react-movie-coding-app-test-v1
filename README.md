# Frontend React Coding Assessment

A movie review web app showcasing current movies and TVshows.

### üèÅ Getting Started

To get started, first you need to clone the repo then install the dependencies you need to run the app. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) from version 20 ^ installed. To install the dependence run this code in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm install #recommended
# or
npm install
#or
yarn
#or
bun install
```

While instating the dependencies, we need to get the free `API` key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) settings API page [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). To find your api key just goto the `Settings` page then click on `API ` from the sidebar options.

After you have gained your `API` key you can duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename the copy to `.env` then replace the value of `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY` with the `API` key you got from [TMDB API page](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

Once thats done, you can run the the following command to start the app.

```bash
pnpm dev #recommended
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
bun dev
```
